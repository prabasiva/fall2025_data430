## What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is a **query language for APIs** and a **runtime for executing those queries** by using a type system you define for your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Declarative Data Fetching**: Clients specify exactly what data they need
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST with multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint
- **Strongly Typed**: Schema defines the structure and types of available data
- **Hierarchical**: Queries match the shape of the data returned
- **Introspective**: API can be queried for schema details

### Simple Example:

**Query:**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice Smith",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how the response shape matches the query shape exactly!

## How GraphQL Works

### 1. Schema Definition

The schema is the contract between client and server. It defines:
- **Types**: What data is available
- **Fields**: What properties each type has
- **Queries**: How to read data
- **Mutations**: How to modify data

**Example Schema:**
```graphql
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Query {
  user(id: Int!): User
  users: [User!]!
  post(id: Int!): Post
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User!
  createPost(title: String!, content: String!, authorId: Int!): Post!
}
```

### 2. Resolvers

Resolvers are functions that fetch the data for each field in your schema.

**Example Resolver (Python):**
```python
@strawberry.field
def user(self, id: int) -> Optional[User]:
    # Fetch user from database
    user_data = db.get_user_by_id(id)
    return User(**user_data) if user_data else None
```

### 3. Query Execution

When a query arrives:

1. **Parsing**: GraphQL parses the query string into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. **Validation**: Checks if query is valid against schema
3. **Execution**: Calls resolvers for each requested field
4. **Response**: Returns data in the exact shape requested

**Flow Diagram:**
```

Parse & Validate
     ↓
Execute Resolvers
     ↓
Fetch Data (Database/API)
     ↓
Format Response
     ↓
Return to Client
```

### 4. The Resolver Chain

For nested queries, GraphQL resolves fields hierarchically:

**Query:**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {           # Resolver 1: Fetch user
    name
    posts {               # Resolver 2: Fetch user's posts
      title
      comments {          # Resolver 3: Fetch post's comments
        text
        author {          # Resolver 4: Fetch comment's author
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Resolver Execution Order:**
1. Resolve `user(id: 1)` → Returns User object
2. Resolve `user.posts` → Returns list of Post objects
3. For each post, resolve `post.comments` → Returns list of Comment objects
4. For each comment, resolve `comment.author` → Returns User object

## Core Concepts

### 1. Types

**Scalar Types** (built-in):
- `Int`: Signed 32-bit integer
- `Float`: Signed double-precision floating-point
- `String`: UTF-8 character sequence
- `Boolean`: true or false
- `ID`: Unique identifier

**Object Types** (custom):
```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int
  email: String!
}
```

**Type Modifiers:**
- `String`: Nullable string
- `String!`: Non-null string (required)
- `[String]`: Nullable list of nullable strings
- `[String!]!`: Non-null list of non-null strings

### 2. Queries

Queries are read operations:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

**With Variables:**
```graphql
query GetUser($userId: Int!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    name
    email
  }
}

# Variables:
{
  "userId": 1
}
```

### 3. Mutations

Mutations are write operations:

```graphql
mutation CreateUser {
  createUser(input: {
    name: "John Doe"
    email: "john@example.com"
  }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### 4. Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable real-time updates:

```graphql
subscription OnCommentAdded {
  commentAdded(postId: 1) {
    id
    text
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Fragments

Reusable units of fields:

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  name
  email
}

query {
  user(id: 1) {
    ...UserInfo
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Aliases

Query the same field with different arguments:

```graphql
query {
  firstUser: user(id: 1) {
    name
  }
  secondUser: user(id: 2) {
    name
  }
}
```

### 7. Directives

Modify query execution:

```graphql
query GetUser($withEmail: Boolean!) {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email @include(if: $withEmail)
  }
}
```

## Advantages of GraphQL

### 1. **No Over-fetching or Under-fetching**

**Problem with REST:**
```
GET /users/1
→ Returns: { id, name, email, age, address, phone, ... }
// You only need name and email, but get everything
```

**GraphQL Solution:**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
// Get exactly what you need
```

**Benefit**: Reduced bandwidth, faster load times, better performance

### 2. **Single Request for Complex Data**

**REST Approach (Multiple Requests):**
```javascript
// Request 1: Get user
GET /users/1

// Request 2: Get user's posts
GET /users/1/posts

// Request 3: Get comments for each post
GET /posts/1/comments
GET /posts/2/comments
// ... more requests
```
**Total**: 4+ HTTP requests, multiple round trips

**GraphQL Approach (Single Request):**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Total**: 1 HTTP request

**Benefit**: Fewer round trips, reduced latency, improved performance

### 3. **Strongly Typed Schema**

The schema serves as a contract:

```graphql
type User {
  id: Int!          # Must be an integer
  name: String!     # Must be a string
  age: Int          # Optional integer
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Type Safety**: Catches errors at development time
- **Self-Documentation**: Schema is the documentation
- **Auto-completion**: IDEs can provide intelligent suggestions
- **Validation**: Invalid queries are rejected before execution

### 4. **Introspection**

GraphQL APIs are self-documenting:

```graphql
query {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      fields {
        name
        type {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic API documentation
- Tools can discover API capabilities
- GraphQL Playground/GraphiQL for exploration

### 5. **Rapid Product Development**

**Scenario**: Mobile app needs new fields

**REST Approach:**
1. Backend adds new fields to endpoint
2. May break existing clients
3. Or create new versioned endpoint (v2)
4. Maintain multiple versions

**GraphQL Approach:**
1. Backend adds new fields to schema
2. Existing queries continue to work
3. New fields available immediately
4. No versioning needed

**Benefit**: Faster iteration, no API versioning

### 6. **Frontend-Driven Development**

Frontend developers can:
- Request exactly what they need
- Work independently of backend
- Prototype with mock data
- Not blocked by backend API design

### 7. **Real-time Capabilities**

GraphQL Subscriptions enable WebSocket-based real-time updates:

```graphql
subscription {
  messageAdded(roomId: "123") {
    id
    text
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Live chat applications
- Real-time notifications
- Collaborative editing
- Live dashboards

### 8. **Batching and Caching**

**DataLoader Pattern:**
- Batches multiple data requests
- Caches results within a request
- Prevents N+1 query problem

**Example:**
```python
# Without DataLoader: 1 + N queries
user = get_user(1)
for post in user.posts:  # N queries
    print(post.author.name)

# With DataLoader: 2 queries
# 1 query for user, 1 batched query for all authors
```

### 9. **API Evolution Without Versioning**

**Add Fields:**
```graphql
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  # New field - existing queries unaffected
  phoneNumber: String
}
```

**Deprecate Fields:**
```graphql
type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use 'fullName' instead")
  fullName: String!
}
```

### 10. **Better Error Handling**

GraphQL returns partial data even with errors:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "posts": null
    }
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot fetch posts",
      "path": ["user", "posts"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefit**: Graceful degradation, better UX

## GraphQL vs REST

### Quick Comparison

| Feature | REST | GraphQL |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Endpoints** | Multiple (`/users`, `/posts`) | Single (`/graphql`) |
| **Data Fetching** | Fixed response structure | Client specifies fields |
| **Over-fetching** | Common | Eliminated |
| **Under-fetching** | Common (need multiple requests) | Eliminated |
| **Versioning** | URL/header versioning | No versioning needed |
| **Caching** | HTTP caching (easy) | More complex |
| **Learning Curve** | Easier | Steeper |
| **Tooling** | Mature | Growing rapidly |
| **Real-time** | WebSockets/SSE separate | Built-in subscriptions |
| **File Upload** | Native support | Requires additional setup |

### Example Comparison

**Scenario**: Get user with their posts and comments

**REST Approach:**
```javascript
// Request 1
GET /users/1
→ { id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "...", address: "...", ... }

// Request 2
GET /users/1/posts
→ [{ id: 1, title: "...", content: "...", likes: 42, ... }, ...]

// Request 3 (for each post)
GET /posts/1/comments
→ [{ id: 1, text: "...", authorId: 2, createdAt: "...", ... }, ...]
```

**Issues:**
- 3+ HTTP requests
- Over-fetching (getting unused fields)
- Multiple round trips

**GraphQL Approach:**
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      comments {
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- 1 HTTP request
- Exact data needed
- Single round trip
