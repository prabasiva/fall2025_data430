# Web Scraping and PySpark Data Pipeline Project

## Project Overview

In this project, you will build a complete data engineering pipeline that scrapes quotes from the website http://quotes.toscrape.com/, extracts structured data, and stores it in a database using PySpark. This project will give you hands-on experience with web scraping, data processing, and working with distributed data systems.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Data Source

**Website:** http://quotes.toscrape.com/

This website contains multiple pages of quotes, with each quote having:
- Quote text
- Author name
- One or more tags

**Important Notes:**
- The website allows scraping for educational purposes
- You must implement proper rate limiting (add delays between requests)
- Handle pagination to scrape all available pages
- Add appropriate User-Agent headers to your requests

### 2. Required Technologies

You must use the following technologies:

**Core Requirements:**
- **Python 3.8+** as the programming language
- **BeautifulSoup4** for HTML parsing and web scraping
- **Requests** library for fetching web pages
- **PySpark 3.x** for data processing and transformation
- **Database storage** for final data persistence

**Supported Databases (choose one or more):**
- PostgreSQL (recommended for structured data)
- MySQL
- SQLite (for local development/testing)
- MongoDB (if you prefer NoSQL)

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### Phase 1: Web Scraping

You must develop a web scraping module that:

1. **Fetches web pages** from http://quotes.toscrape.com/
   - Start with page 1 and continue until all pages are scraped
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Add appropriate delays between requests (1-2 seconds recommended)

2. **Parses HTML content** to extract:
   - Quote text
   - Author name
   - All associated tags for each quote

3. **Handles pagination**
   - Automatically detect and navigate to next pages
   - Stop when the last page is reached
   - Track page numbers for data lineage

4. **Saves raw data** to an intermediate format
   - Save scraped data as JSON or CSV
   - Include metadata (timestamp, page number)
   - Ensure data can be reloaded for processing

#### Phase 2: Data Processing with PySpark

You must develop a PySpark processing module that:

1. **Loads raw scraped data** into PySpark DataFrames
   - Read from intermediate storage (JSON/CSV)
   - Define appropriate schemas
   - Handle malformed or missing data

2. **Cleans and validates data**
   - Remove duplicate quotes
   - Handle null or empty values
   - Validate data types
   - Trim whitespace and standardize text

3. **Transforms data** for database storage
   - Create appropriate data structures
   - Generate unique identifiers where needed
   - Add derived columns (e.g., quote length, word count)
   - Handle the many-to-many relationship between quotes and tags

4. **Prepares data** for database insertion
   - Structure data according to your database schema
   - Ensure referential integrity
   - Optimize for efficient database writes

#### Phase 3: Database Storage

You must implement database storage that:

1. **Designs an appropriate database schema**
   - Create tables to store quotes, authors, and tags
   - Handle relationships between entities
   - Ensure no data redundancy
   - Support efficient querying

2. **Writes data to the database**
   - Use PySpark's JDBC capabilities or appropriate connectors
   - Handle existing data (decide on update vs. replace strategy)
   - Ensure all data is successfully persisted
   - Implement transaction management

3. **Validates data integrity**
   - Verify all quotes are stored
   - Ensure author-quote relationships are correct
   - Confirm tag associations are maintained
   - Check for data consistency

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

#### Code Quality
- Write modular, reusable code
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate

#### Error Handling
- Implement try-except blocks for error-prone operations
- Log errors with appropriate detail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Ensure the pipeline can recover from failures

#### Logging
- Log all major operations (scraping, processing, storage)
- Include timestamps in log messages
- Use different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Save logs to a file for later review

#### Configuration
- Externalize configuration (URLs, database credentials, etc.)
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Make the pipeline configurable without code changes

#### Documentation
- Write a comprehensive README.md file
- Document how to set up and run the project
- Include examples of expected output
- Document any assumptions or design decisions

## Data Model Requirements

### Source Data Structure

Each page on http://quotes.toscrape.com/ contains multiple quote elements. You need to understand the HTML structure and extract:

- **Quote Text**: The actual quote content
- **Author**: The person who said/wrote the quote
- **Tags**: Multiple tags associated with each quote (e.g., "inspirational", "life", "love")

### Database Schema Design

You must design a database schema that:

1. **Avoids data redundancy**
   - Authors should not be duplicated
   - Tags should not be duplicated
   - Only quotes should potentially have duplicates (which you should handle)

2. **Maintains relationships**
   - Each quote has one author
   - Each quote can have multiple tags
   - Each tag can be associated with multiple quotes
   - Each author can have multiple quotes

3. **Supports efficient querying**
   - Find all quotes by a specific author
   - Find all quotes with a specific tag
   - Find all tags for a specific quote
   - Count quotes per author or per tag

4. **Includes appropriate metadata**
   - When the data was scraped
   - Unique identifiers for each entity
   - Any other relevant information

**Think about:**
- What tables do you need?
- What are the primary keys?
- What are the foreign keys?
- Should you use a normalized schema (multiple tables with relationships) or a denormalized schema (fewer tables with some redundancy)?

## Technical Challenges to Consider

As you work on this project, you'll need to address several challenges:

### Web Scraping Challenges
- How do you detect when you've reached the last page?
- How do you handle network timeouts or errors?
- How do you ensure you're not overwhelming the server?
- How do you structure the extracted data for later processing?

### Data Processing Challenges
- How do you handle duplicate quotes?
- What if a quote has no tags or no author?
- How do you efficiently handle the many-to-many relationship between quotes and tags?
- How do you ensure data quality and consistency?

### Database Challenges
- How do you design tables to avoid redundancy?
- How do you generate or manage unique identifiers?

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many quotes should I expect to scrape?**
A: The website contains approximately 100 quotes across 10 pages, but this may change. Your code should handle any number of pages.

**Q: What should I do if the website is down?**
A: Implement error handling and retry logic. If the website is persistently down, contact the instructor.

**Q: Can I use a different website?**
A: No, you must use http://quotes.toscrape.com/ as specified. This ensures consistent grading.

**Q: Do I need to run Spark in a cluster?**
A: No, you can run Spark in local mode for this project. However, you must use PySpark for data processing.

**Q: What if I scrape the same data multiple times?**
A: Your pipeline should handle this. Decide whether to skip duplicates, update existing records, or replace all data. Document your decision.

**Q: Can I use pandas instead of PySpark?**
A: No, you must use PySpark as specified. This is a learning objective for the course.

**Q: How much time should this take?**
A: Plan for 20-30 hours total, spread over several weeks. This includes learning, development, testing, and documentation.

**Q: What if I've never used PySpark before?**
A: Review the course materials and PySpark documentation. Start with simple operations and build up complexity.
