# Apache Spark & PySpark Analytics Project
## 3-Week Advanced Data Processing Sprint

**Course Module**: Big Data Analytics with Spark  
**Project Type**: Team Sprint (3 members)  
**Duration**: 3 Weeks (15 working days)  
**Prerequisites**: Completed ETL Pipeline Project (or equivalent)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Title
**Scalable Data Processing and Analytics with Apache Spark**

### 1.2 Project Context
Building upon your previous ETL pipeline project, your team will now process the same business data (customers, products, orders) at scale using Apache Spark. You will migrate from traditional batch processing to distributed computing, implementing both batch and stream processing capabilities while adding advanced analytics features.

### 1.3 Learning Objectives
- Master Apache Spark fundamentals and architecture
- Develop proficiency in PySpark DataFrame operations
- Implement distributed data processing pipelines
- Create real-time streaming analytics
- Optimize Spark jobs for performance
- Build machine learning models using MLlib
- Compare traditional ETL vs. distributed processing

### 1.4 Business Scenario
Your company has grown from processing 1,000 records to millions of records daily. The existing PostgreSQL-based pipeline cannot scale. Management wants to:
1. Process historical data for analytics (batch processing)
2. Provide real-time sales dashboards (stream processing)
3. Implement customer segmentation (machine learning)
4. Generate performance comparison reports
